# Fake-News-Detection

The main objective was to detect fake news on social media using the features extracted from textual dataset collected from Kaggle and used to train various machine learning, deep learning, bert-based and tranformer models.
Various explainability techniques such as LIME and SHAP were used to explain the deep learning models.
